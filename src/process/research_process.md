2. Created phased approach to build knowledge systematically
3. Developed progression from foundational knowledge to specialized applications
4. Established clear deliverables for each research phase

### 4.3 Systematic Research Execution

Research was conducted systematically following the research plan:

1. Core testing fundamentals for university environments
2. Framework-specific research for each technology
3. Specialized testing needs (accessibility, performance, security)
4. Implementation approaches and risk management
5. Synthesis of findings into comprehensive frameworks

### 4.4 Knowledge Management

As research progressed, knowledge management evolved:

1. Initially stored findings in Claude Projects
2. Encountered context limitations as research expanded
3. Transitioned to local repository for more effective management
4. Organized files by research phase and technology area

### 4.5 Documentation Development

The documentation approach evolved throughout the process:

1. Created structured markdown outputs from each research phase
2. Developed interconnections between research areas
3. Organized content for logical progression
4. Compiled findings into comprehensive website using mdbook

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

### 5.1 Technical Limitations

**Challenge**: Research feature not available on mobile devices.
**Solution**: Scheduled research sessions specifically when desktop access was available, limiting flexibility.

**Challenge**: Context window limitations in Claude Projects.
**Solution**: Transitioned to local file management and implemented systematic file organization strategies.

**Challenge**: Rate limiting when using both Research and Claude Code simultaneously.
**Solution**: Alternated between research sessions and code development, avoiding simultaneous use.

**Challenge**: Source preservation when moving research to Project Knowledge.
**Solution**: Had Claude create bibliographies within the original research sessions before knowledge transfer.

### 5.2 Process Challenges

**Challenge**: Researcher (Nate) becoming the bottleneck in the research process when reviewing extensive materials.
**Solution**: Read the previous report while Claude researches the next, this approach could benefit from dividing research among multiple Claude-assisted researchers.

**Challenge**: Managing multiple interconnected research threads without losing coherence.
**Solution**: Developed organizational structure based on research phases and technology areas, with clear cross-references between related topics.

**Challenge**: Translating research findings into actionable implementation guidance.
