# Playwright launch: Transforming testing for university digital services

## Bottom line up front
This implementation plan provides a structured, phased approach for adopting Playwright as the UI testing framework for the university's student portals, applications, and registration systems. The plan spans 12 months, requires approximately $15,000 in initial investment, and will establish comprehensive end-to-end testing coverage while ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. Beginning with a small pilot before the next registration period, it gradually expands to full coverage of critical systems by the following academic year. The plan addresses the unique challenges of university environments including academic calendars, registration peaks, and accessibility compliance while working within the constraints of a small development team.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)

### Assessment and initial setup
- Conduct audit of existing testing and identify critical gaps in current test coverage
- Create inventory of all web applications requiring testing, prioritizing by:
  1. Student impact (# of users affected)
  2. Severity of potential issues (registration > informational pages)
  3. Complexity and rate of change
- Form a cross-functional Playwright implementation team including:
  - 1 lead developer to serve as "Playwright champion"
  - 1 frontend specialist familiar with React components
  - 1 team member with QA experience or strong testing interest
- Document existing authentication flows and identify test account requirements
- Select Azure Pipeline configuration for CI/CD integration

### Environment setup and proof of concept
- Install Playwright and configure development environments for all team members
- Set up shared repository for test code with proper structure:
```
tests/
├── e2e/           # End-to-end tests
├── components/    # Component-level tests
├── fixtures/      # Reusable test fixtures
│   ├── auth.js    # Authentication fixtures
├── utils/         # Shared testing utilities
└── config/        # Environment-specific configurations
```
- Implement SSO authentication helper to handle Microsoft Entra ID login:
```typescript
// auth.setup.ts
import { test as setup } from '@playwright/test';

setup('authenticate', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://portal.university.edu/login');
  await page.fill('input[name="loginfmt"]', process.env.TEST_USERNAME);
  await page.click('input[type="submit"]');
  await page.fill('input[name="passwd"]', process.env.TEST_PASSWORD);
  await page.click('input[type="submit"]');
  // Skip 2FA for test accounts
  await page.click('input[id="idBtn_Back"]'); // Stay signed in
  
  // Save authentication state
  await page.context().storageState({ path: 'auth.json' });
});
```
- Create initial Azure Pipeline YAML configuration:
```yaml
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: ubuntu-latest

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '18'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: npm ci
  displayName: 'Install Dependencies'

- script: npx playwright install --with-deps
  displayName: 'Install Playwright Browsers'

- script: npx playwright test
  displayName: 'Run Playwright Tests'
  env:
    TEST_USERNAME: $(TestAccountUsername)
    TEST_PASSWORD: $(TestAccountPassword)

- task: PublishTestResults@2
  displayName: 'Publish Test Results'
  inputs:
    testResultsFormat: 'JUnit'
    testResultsFiles: 'test-results/junit-*.xml'
  condition: succeededOrFailed()

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    targetPath: playwright-report
    artifact: playwright-report
    publishLocation: 'pipeline'
  condition: succeededOrFailed()
```

### Initial training and pilot testing
- Provide initial training (20-30 hours per developer) covering:
  - Playwright fundamentals and test writing
  - Authentication strategies for university systems
  - Page Object Model pattern implementation
  - Debugging Playwright tests
- Develop pilot test suite for one non-critical application (e.g., campus directory)
- Document lessons learned and initial best practices

## Phase 2: Expansion (Months 3-4)

### Infrastructure and standards development
- Implement Page Object Model pattern for maintainable tests:
```typescript
// pages/LoginPage.ts
import { Page } from '@playwright/test';

export class LoginPage {
  readonly page: Page;
  
  constructor(page: Page) {
    this.page = page;
  }
  
  async login(username: string, password: string) {
    await this.page.goto('https://portal.university.edu/login');
    await this.page.fill('input[name="loginfmt"]', username);
    await this.page.click('input[type="submit"]');
    await this.page.fill('input[name="passwd"]', password);
    await this.page.click('input[type="submit"]');
    // Skip 2FA in test environment
    await this.page.click('input[id="idBtn_Back"]');
  }
}
```
- Establish coding standards and best practices document for test development
- Create accessibility testing integration with axe-core:
```typescript
// accessibility.setup.ts
import { test as base } from '@playwright/test';
import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

export const test = base.extend({
  makeAxeBuilder: async ({ page }, use) => {
    const makeAxeBuilder = () => new AxeBuilder({ page })
      // Target WCAG 2.1 AA standards
      .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
      // Exclude third-party content if needed
      .exclude(['.third-party-widget']);
    
    await use(makeAxeBuilder);
  }
});

export { expect } from '@playwright/test';
```
- Configure Azure Test Plans integration for detailed test management

test.describe('Registration system tests', () => {
  // Critical tests always run
  test('student can search for courses', async ({ page }) => {
    // Test implementation
  });
  
  // Heavy load tests only during pre-registration periods
  test('system handles concurrent registrations', async ({ page }) => {
    test.skip(!isRegistrationPeriod(), 'Only runs during registration periods');
    // Load test implementation
  });
});
```
- Develop monitoring dashboards for test results and system performance
- Run controlled test during a minor registration period (summer classes)

### Cross-browser and accessibility validation
- Expand testing to cover all required browsers:
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
import { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';

export default defineConfig({
  projects: [
    {
      name: 'chromium',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'firefox',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'webkit',
      use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] },
    },
    {
      name: 'edge',
      use: { 
        ...devices['Desktop Edge'], 
        channel: 'msedge'
      },
    },
  ],
});
```
