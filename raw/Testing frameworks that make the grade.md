# Testing frameworks that make the grade

This comprehensive evaluation provides university-specific testing framework recommendations for Pro*C, PL/SQL, Groovy, and TypeScript/JavaScript technologies, with implementation strategies tailored to the unique challenges of R1 research environments.

## Bottom line up front

After thorough research, we recommend Playwright for UI testing, Spock for Groovy, utPLSQL for PL/SQL, and custom C testing frameworks with database fixtures for Pro*C. These frameworks excel in university environments by supporting accessibility compliance, academic calendar integration, and peak-period performance while minimizing costs. Implementation should follow a phased approach aligned with academic calendars, with significant focus on cross-departmental collaboration and specialized training to accommodate decentralized IT governance.

Educational institutions present unique testing challenges that commercial frameworks often don't address: decentralized governance, complex integration requirements, strict accessibility compliance, and extreme usage spikes during registration periods. Our recommendations specifically account for these factors while balancing technical capabilities with institutional constraints.

## Pro*C and PL/SQL testing frameworks

### Pro*C testing framework analysis

Testing options for Pro*C are limited due to its legacy nature, with three primary approaches available:

1. **Oracle Pro*C/C++ Precompiler Tools**
   - Native Oracle toolkit providing basic preprocessing of embedded SQL
   - Limited testing capabilities beyond syntax checking
   - Useful for simple validation but inadequate for comprehensive testing

2. **Generic C/C++ Testing Frameworks with Pro*C Extensions**
   - CUnit and Google Test can be extended for Pro*C with custom database fixtures
   - Parasoft C/C++test offers commercial database testing capabilities
   - Requires custom development to handle embedded SQL effectively

3. **Custom Testing Harnesses**
   - Many universities develop in-house solutions for Pro*C testing
   - Typically use controlled database states and comparison of expected results
   - Labor-intensive but highly customizable to university-specific needs

**Code coverage analysis** for Pro*C is challenging, with limited options including EMMA, JaCoCo adaptations, and Parasoft C/C++test. Mocking capabilities are similarly constrained, with most institutions developing custom approaches to isolate Pro*C code from actual database connections.

**Performance testing** during academic peak periods typically relies on:
- Oracle Database Replay to capture workloads during actual peak periods
- Apache JMeter with JDBC support for simulating user loads
- Custom performance testing harnesses with embedded timing functions

### PL/SQL testing framework analysis

PL/SQL offers more robust testing options, with several frameworks well-suited to university environments:

1. **utPLSQL**
   - Open-source unit testing framework with Apache 2.0 license
   - Comprehensive test data management through fixture setup/teardown
   - Excellent code coverage reporting with multiple output formats
   - Substantial community support and documentation
